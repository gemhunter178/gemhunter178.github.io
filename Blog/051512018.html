      <p>So, today was the first official day of classes for this trip. Just have to say the view from up there is real cool. We had another group dinner today at <a href="https://www.marche-movenpick.ca/en/our-locations/brookfield-place-street-level">MARCHÉ MÖVENPICK</a>. Really cool way of getting food- we were given cards to use at "islands" with certain types of food. I haven't experienced anything like this, but apparently it does exist in the States.</p>
