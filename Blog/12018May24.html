      <p style="text-indent: 25px">Today started like any other: wake up at 6:30AM, be in class by 9AM. Unlike any previous day though, we were let out at 11 to meet with our community partners. So, that is exactly what my team and I did.
      </p><p style="text-indent: 25px">After the meeting, I decided to return to <a href="http://riverdalefarmtoronto.ca/">Riverdale Farm</a> to take some pictures and enjoy my time instead of having an assignment to worry about. (See <a href="/Blog/12018May16">my previous post</a> for my last trip there.)
      </p><p style="text-indent: 25px">So, I left the building we are staying at at around.... 2 or 3PM?. On the road, I passed by the garden I based by last project on (see <a href="/Blog/12018May18">this</a> post). So, I took some extra clips while I was there. Perhaps I'll revise my project again. Anyways, I ended up lost in Cabbagetown as I had walked too far North. Only when I walked out of Cabbagetown did I realize I was a bit off.
      </p><p style="text-indent: 25px">Turning back, I realized I needed to hurry a little bit for the time I lost in getting lost. Soon I was back on track. About 10 mintues later, I was at the farm!
      </p><p style="text-indent: 25px">Today was a beautiful day to take pictures. There was baely a cloud in the sky. Th grass was a vibrant green. The cherry? tree in front of the farm was in full bloom. Ah what a scene. I spent the next hour or so taking my time and taking pictures. I didn't realize the time passing until I was kicked out at 5: closing time.
