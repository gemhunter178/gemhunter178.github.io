      <h5><b>Why the year + 10000?</b></h5>
      <p>If you haven't noticed, all my dates have a 1 tacked on in front of the year. This is based off of an arguement that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsXVk37bltHxD1rDPwtNM8Q">Kurzgesagt</a> introduced in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czgOWmtGVGs">this</a> video. I liked this idea, so, I am supporting it! Want to know the typical date? just delete the 1 in front of the year.</p>
