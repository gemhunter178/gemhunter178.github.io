      <p style="text-indent: 25px">Ok, so I didn't get any pictures of my doing VR. Oh well.
      </p><p style="text-indent: 25px">Anyways, today was a very busy, but also relaxing day. Our morning started off uneventfully: We had to finish our dérive maps, so I was running photoshop and paint.NET between the two and using the pictures I took <a href="/Blog/12018May24">there.</a>
      </p><p style="text-indent: 25px">After that, we were instructed to walk to a place called <a href="http://houseofvr.com/">House of VR</a>. It was a cool walk. I got to see more of the wentern side of town (Parkdale regon). On this walk, we stopped to get all-you-can-eat sushi, which as delicious, and passed our destination to look around (we had 30 minutes to kill). So, we found....a toy store.
      </p><p style="text-indent: 25px">After some waiting and conversation, we were finally ready to try our some VR stuff. 
      </p><p style="text-indent: 25px">We started with some documentaries/"non-games" at first. Out of all of these documentaries, I liked <a href="https://www.manifest99.com/">Manifest 99</a> the best 
      </p><p style="text-indent: 25px">I didn't actually run through all the games provided as we only got 3 hours there. I do have to say watching others get into games is a cool and sometimes amusing position.
      </p><p style="text-indent: 25px">Ok, I am literally slamming my head against my latop and suddenly waking up from exhaustion...So I think I'll cut this very short. Sorry if today's blog went all over the place.
      </p><p style="text-indent: 25px">If you have a chance to try VR (like an HTC vive or Oculus), try it!
