      <p style="text-indent: 25px">Today was the second day of <a href="https://www.toronto.ca/explore-enjoy/festivals-events/doors-open-toronto/" target="_blank">Doors Open Toronto</a> where many buildings that are normally closed to the public are open... to the public. Also, it was our second day off on this program.
      </p><p style="text-indent: 25px">So, after my usual morning routine, I was able to go back upstairs to the common room on our floor. Everyone was (probably) still asleep, so I took this time to start drawing a better picture for my 404 page. I saw some friends go out for breakfast at 10AM.
      </p><p style="text-indent: 25px">After around noon, a few classmates got back, but they seemed to tired to do anything just yet... so, we took a break for another 2 or so hours.
      </p><p style="text-indent: 25px">At around 2PM, we fiinally got up to go explore Doors Open.
      </p><p style="text-indent: 25px">It was warm out today. The sun was beaming down where the city buildings would let it. We alked for about 20 minutes before coming to out first stop: Osgoode Hall. Inside, we saw a mix of old architecture and design mixed with the new computers that were needed in a court room and supporting places. I especially liked the roof of the place: some stained glass here, some stonework there, all very neat!
      <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/157149974@N06/40591967760/in/dateposted-public/" target="_blank"><img src="//c1.staticflickr.com/2/1759/40591967760_cb4ab41d55_k.jpg" alt="The roof of Osgoode Hall" class="gallerypic" style="max-width: 100%; max-height: none; margin: 0 auto"></a>
      </p><p style="text-indent: 25px">After we had our fill of looking around, we walked another few blocks down to the Design Exchange and tried our hand at screen printing. Somewhere along this journey we found ourselves in the <a href="http://torontopath.com/" target="_blank">PATH</a>. Today was Sunday, so the dim lighting and absence of people gave an odd atmosphere to the otherwise clean and sharp look of the place. Few minutes later, we exited on the same block we started at, but completely disoriented. They're not kidding when they say it's easy to get lost in the PATH.
      </p><p style="text-indent: 25px">Anyways, in short, today was a nice, well-needed day of break to get our bearings and explore the city. I enjoyed it very much!
