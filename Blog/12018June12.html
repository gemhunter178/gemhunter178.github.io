      <p style="text-indent: 25px">Today is our only official day off here in Sheffield. So, what do I do? I keep working (which is what I did yesterday). I did make time in my schedule to look at some gift shops as well as visit the <a href="http://www.sbg.org.uk/" target="_blank">Sheffield Botanical Gardens</a>, which I will probably be talking about today.
      </p><p style="text-indent: 25px">Of course, I also went back to the AR section for the final day of the festival to say "see you later" to those I have made friends with. It's bittersweet.
      </p><p style="text-indent: 25px">Anyways, I walked over to the botanical gardens, camera in hand. On the way, birds chirped as I passed a park. The city seemed to give way into a dense town. There were so many trees around.
      </p><p style="text-indent: 25px">I arrived at the garden and walked though the lare gates that marked the entrance. I walked pass some well planted flower beds and made my way to the "glass pavilon" (which is a very long greenhouse with plants of all continents minus Antarctica).
      </p><p style="text-indent: 25px">After my visit to the greenhouse, I managed to walk through and experience every garden with a topic as well as a large portion of the Gardens. I specifically liked the trees and the rose garden.
      </p><p style="text-indent: 25px">Want some more pictures from this trip? I may put them here later. If not, contact me?
