      <p style="text-indent: 25px">I've been trying out so many exhibitions at the <a href="https://sheffdocfest.com/interactive/overview" target="_blank">Sheffield AR exhibits</a> these two days. I have to say I am thoroughly impressed.
      </p><p style="text-indent: 25px">I have been booked almost full trying out as many exhibits as possible. It's so hard to describe them all, so, I'll leave links to their project pages. Here are some highlights (in no particular order) and my quick summary of them:
      </p><ul>
        <li><a href="http://www.eyesteelfilm.com/web-projects/manic-vr/" target="_blank">Manic VR</a> - This is an amazing journey into the bipolar imaginations of Kalina’s (the director's) brother and sister through the voicemails they have left her. I can't do this one justice. How could I explain feeling power and then seeing it taken away and then seeing me destroy my own world? Do trust me, this is a good one.</li>
        <li><a href="http://vestige-vr.com/" target="_blank">Vestige</a> - A story of Lisa losing her beloved Erik told in a phone call and done to capture the loss she felt. I definitely did not do it justice in this description. This piece made me cry and think of my friends. "My heart shattered like Erik".</li>
        <li><a href="https://sheffdocfest.com/films/6576" target="_blank">Terminal 3</a> - (I actually couldn't find the link to this, sorry!) You are a US customs officer interogating a hologram passenger. This piece was done on the hololens and is an AR experience in a very well done set. If you want to see AR done well, I recommend this.</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.thedaytheworldchanged.world/" target="_blank">The Day the World Changed</a> - I would call this a warning to humanity and the touchy subject of nuclear weapons. If you want to see scale and moving effects in VR done right, this is a great piece to see. There is also a certain scene that works very well in VR and could not be framed with the same effect.</li>
        <li><a href="https://sheffdocfest.com/films/6571" target="_blank">Is Anna OK?</a> - (I actually couldn't find the link to this, sorry!) This experience describes two twins, Lauren and Anna, going through a tragedy that left Anna without much memory and with a different personality. This story is told with 2 views: one for each of the twins. I was fortunate enough to see both.</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.facetofacestory.com/" target="_blank">Face to Face</a> - This is the story of Michelle, her injury, her resilience. The experience takes you through three rooms, each with a different part of the story. Beautifully done set, meeting Michelle capped it all off for me.</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.factory42.uk/holdtheworld" target="_blank">Hold the World with David Attenborough</a> - You get to explore, learn about, and hold some rare specimens in London’s Natural History Museum with David Attenborough as your guide. Very well rigged and animated. A great teaching tool.</li>
        <li><a href="http://www.thejohnrobertson.com/thedarkroom/" target="_blank">The Dark Room</a> - "You awake to find yourself in THE DARK ROOM..." OK, there really isn't a way to do this justice, but its a real time, live adventure game where one must escape "the dark room" or DIE. It's hilarious. My voice is going to hurt after this...</li>
      </ul><p style="text-indent: 25px">OK, it's getting late here... I do need sleep, these days have been a good type of tiring. Do visit the links if you can. As with the projects, the people who made them are also very cool and (to me) surprisingly nice! Do support them!
