    <div class="w3-container">
      <p style="text-indent: 25px">Yesterday, our class went to the <a href="http://www.simt.co.uk/kelham-island-museum" target="_blank">Kelham Island Museum</a> for our last group activity before presentations.
      </p><p style="text-indent: 25px">I found it interesting to see the history of Sheffield as a cnter for metal works. Personally, I was interested in the woods and materials used to make things in the past, such as silverware that is actually silver... or all the bone/ivory material. I may be against the use of it, but I can find it pretty in a historic context.
      </p><p style="text-indent: 25px">Seeing the River Don Engine at the musuem in action left me in awe. The amount of power that that engine has and how little it would care if someone dropped a wrench into the system was both stunning...but terrifying. To think this engine was made in 1905 to roll steel is amazing, especially how smoothly it runs. A steampunk world ran on engines like these would have been cool.
      </p><br>
      <p style="text-indent: 25px">Anyways, not much happened today, even though I wanted to go to the Peaks District, since I had to get some work done. This is the final stretch! Maybe tomorrow.
      </p><p style="text-indent: 25px">For those who don't want to read about existential stuff and/or question about it, I would stop here.
      </p><br><br>
      <p style="text-indent: 25px">They gone? OK. Well, we're only here in Sheffield for another 2 days... actually, not even. I was washing my clothes at the local laundromat when I thought about how there are "minor characters" in your life story - people you will see, forget, and never see again - and I realized that these nice people running the laundromat were going to be one of those. When I left today, that was probably the last time I will see them. Not because of something crazy or unusual, but due to circumstances.
      </p><!--Mr Bubbles is the place--><p style="text-indent: 25px">I thought about how I am one of those characters in so many people's life story. I hated the thought, but, no one can remember everyone. Maybe it's partly because I edited my review on VESTIGE (see <a href="https://gemhunter178.com/Blog/12018June09.html target="_blank">this post</a> for a description) today. I had the quote from Banksy about dying two deaths on it.
      </p><p style="text-indent: 25px">I concluded this crisis with the thought, "We can't be major characters in everyone's life, but we should try to be in for the people who matter to us"
      </p><p style="text-indent: 25px">Don't be a minor character to someone you care about. Someday it may be too late to change that.
      </p><!--Satterwhite Family, if you're reading this...you're major. May I be the same for you too. &lt;3-->
