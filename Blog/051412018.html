      <p>Testing if this blog thing is working. I'm currently abroad for a half-semester of study in Toronto! I'm going to be here for 3 weeks studying AR/VR storytelling. Today we went to <a href="http://www.kinka.com/canada/">KINKA IZAKAYA</a> for dinner. Great restaurant, love the atmosphere... but might be a bit loud for people who like a quiet meal. I fully approve though! Hopefully I can get the rest of this blog thing figured out soon. I'll keep you guys posted!</p>
