      <p style="text-indent: 25px">Yesterday (sorry no blog post, but I didn't plan on doing them daily anyways), I went with a friend to see <a href="https://www.ripleyaquariums.com/canada" target="_blank">Ripley's Aquarium</a> and the <a href="www.cntower.ca/intro.html" target="_blank">CN tower</a>. I always love a good aquarium, and this was no different.
      </p><p style="text-indent: 25px"> Now, going to the CN tower, we went at around 8:45PM, which meant we got to see the city transititon from day into night. It was an amazing view. I'll let the pictures below show some of it, but they don't do it justice!
