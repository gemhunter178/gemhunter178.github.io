      <p style="text-indent: 25px">This is the belated post I mentioned in my sleep deprived state yesterday! The last day of Paris I went back to the Jardin des Plantes and got to see the meteorite exhibit that was there. Then we walked back along the Seine and saw structures like the Bastille or the Notre-Dame de Paris. 
      </p><p style="text-indent: 25px">Anyways, on our walk, we passed by some sort of fashion thing. So many people waiting on the already-crowded streets with nice cameras waiting for...something? Either way, we also made a point to visit a place that sold macarons. They're so delicious!
      </p><p style="text-indent: 25px">The next day, at 4:30AM, I had to get up for my flight. We arranged a taxi for us to bring us to the airport. There, we did the usual airport things and went to LHR for our transfer (it was on this flight that I took the picutre above). There, I had to change terminals. They were already boarding the plane when I got to the right gate. 
      </p><p style="text-indent: 25px">Anyways, 4 movies later, I landed at Logan Airport and got picked up by a friend of mine, who's basically my second mother. We went to the Tower Hill Botanical Garden and looked at some flowers. Then we headed back to my hometown and got dinner. I did not have time to nap once I got home becasue hen I had to go back into Boston to pick up my parents.
      </p><p style="text-indent: 25px">Once I got to the phone lot, I waited a bit, then ended up falling asleep.
      </p><p style="text-indent: 25px">I woke up, in the drivers seat. 
      </p><p style="text-indent: 25px">I had a slight panic attack and hoped I did not just fall asleep behind the wheel. Then, I just remembered I was parked, so everything was ok. I finally got a message from my parents. Apparently they had been sitting on the tarmac for a while and just got to the terminal building. This was a 40 minute delay. Thank goodness I took a nap.
      </p><p style="text-indent: 25px">Nothing else really eventful happened afterwards. We kinda just got home, my parents had dinner, and then we fell asleep.
      </p>
