I really like making cool projects that break a usual constraint I'm given. In this case, the limitation of "being on the ground" and "low speed."

Usually, the boards we use in the classroom never (intentionally) leave the ground. So, to take to the skies, I decided to start this project on my own terms in the Fall of 2016.

First thing I realized was if I was going to build anything that could easily fly free outdoors, it was going to cost me. So, I spent the next month or so researching what parts I need, what cost can be expected and comparing this to what I wanted to get out of my copter.

I bought all the necessary parts to fly, leaving a few parts that I would buy later such a monitor for the camera. As soon as the parts arrived, I brought them to the makerspace I go to for assembly. Here, I connected, soldered, calibrated, and did everything else I needed to get my copter flying.

Being at the makerspace meant that I could ask some experienced members for help whenever I encountered a problem I could not easily fix. This expedited the process. Before winter came, the copter was ready for its maiden flight.
