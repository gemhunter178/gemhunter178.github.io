I have been 3D printing ever since my brother got a SeeMeeCNC Rostock printer many many years ago.

Never ceases to amaze me how something I design on a computer can be made into reality in the matter of hours.... now potentially minutes!

<!-- end excerpt -->

Since then, I have used many different FDM printers - some in school, some at the makerspace - and have been introduced to even more types of 3D printers, such as powder printing or using layered sheets of paper.

Using 3D printing, I have made many stand designs for my various other hobbies, as well as making some example objects for display. I have also designed and printed an "electric hardanger fiddle" that is only missing a good set of tuning pegs at this point.
