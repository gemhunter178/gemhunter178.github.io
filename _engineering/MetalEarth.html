This Metal Earth Apollo capsule kit was given to me by a friend a long time ago...

I only got around to finishing it in 2019.

Part of the reason this is here right now is for website design testing purposes, but the other reason this is because I liked the complexity of the build.

...Also, it means I can assemble very tiny things. I think only one piece snapped in building this, and cyanoacrylate was precisely placed to fix it.
