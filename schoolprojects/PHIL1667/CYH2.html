				<p>Charlie Holloway is a character in Ridley Scott’s <i>Prometheus</i>, which is part of the Alien franchise. He is an archaeologist along with Elizabeth Shaw, who is his lover. They find signs that all ancient civilizations knew of a certain constellation, showing that humans may have originated there. From this information, they embark on a journey to find the ones that created them. Holloway is a little less cautious than Shaw as he is willing to take risks such as taking off his helmet in a foreign, possibly hostile environment.

				<p>Holloway starts off along with Shaw as archaeologists on Earth. His call to action would be Shaw discovering the constellation that they found in many other ancient civilizations once more. This gives enough evidence to sponsor an expedition this constellation. As a result, Holloway and Shaw cross the threshold physically and metaphorically by travelling to another planet. Here, they face the challenges and trials of being on a planet that houses weapons meant to kill them. Instead of achieving his final goals, Holloway dies from trickery from the android, David, who slips the Engineer’s bioweapon into his drink.
