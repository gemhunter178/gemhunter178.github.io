				<p>Rey is a character from <i>Star Wars VII: The Force Awakens</i>. She lives on the planet Jakku working a salvaging job for her meals. In her lower class state, she still proves a more than capable fighter, fighting off a group of muggers trying to steal BB-8 from her early in the film. In addition, she is able to use the force, even without training.

				<p>Rey starts off in her original world of Jakku. Her call to adventure occurs when she meets BB-8 and refuses to sell them, which leads to the merchant trying to steal BB-8 from her and failing. Rey can be argued to have a second call to action when she first touches Luke’s lightsaber, in which she refuses by saying she’ll never touch that thing again. This could also the meeting of the mentor as she is given an artifact to aid her in future trials. Rey crosses the threshold as she is not given the option to return home as she is caught by the first order. This also presents her trials as she tries to keep information away from Kylo and also try to escape imprisonment. The temptress in this case would be the option to just give up and possibly go back home to wait. Now Rey is fully in the resistance as she aids them in destroying Starkiller Base. Her journey continues on in the following movies.
