				<p>Rotwang is a character in Fritz Lang’s <i>Metropolis</i>. He is the stereotypical “mad scientist” in films as he runs a lab in a small building in the middle of the city. He also has access to the catacombs as well as where Maria hosts meetings. He is angry at Joh Fredersen as he blames Joh for the death of the person he loved, Hel, who was Joh’s wife. He is able to develop advanced new technology.

				<p>Rotwang stars out in his own world of the lab, but, when requested by Joh, he uses his own technology to try to stop the rebellion. Here, he physically leaves his world and crosses the threshold into the catacombs, where he corners and kidnaps Maria to use her image on the “Machine Man” he created. Trials and challenges happen as he tries to control the “Machine Man” to secretly have revenge on Joh while still looking like he is helping him. This ends with the destruction of the “Machine Man” by the angry mob of working class people, which then leads to the end of Rotwang as he is obsessed with catching Maria. His journey ends here as he is killed in the action.
