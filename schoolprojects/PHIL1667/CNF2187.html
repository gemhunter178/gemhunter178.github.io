				<p>Finn is a character in <i>Star Wars VII: The Force Awakens</i>. He is an ex-stormtrooper who had the designation FN-2187. Kidnapped in his early childhood, the brainwash pushed on him broke when one of his comrades died in front of him, making a representation of the brutality that side was enforcing. As an ex-stormtrooper, he provides invaluable knowledge to aid the resistance.

				<p>Finn starts of in his own world with the first order as he was forced into it at a young age. His call to action happens as one of his comrades dies in front of him and smears blood over his helmet. He is then helped into the rebellion by Poe, who escapes with him and crash lands on Jakku. Finn’s refusal of the call happens later at Maz’s temple as he wants to run far away into the outer rim rather than attempt to fight the first order. Kylo abducting Rey then becomes the event that reverses this, and Finn crosses the threshold into fully fighting for the rebellion. This can be seen when the other stormtrooper he faces calls him “traitor” before dueling it out with energy weapons. Finn then faces challenges and trials as he tries to use his inside knowledge to bring down Starkiller Base for the rebellion. This done, Finn’s journey continues into the next movie.
