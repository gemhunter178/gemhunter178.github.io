				<p>The T-800 in <i>Terminator 2: Judgement Day</i> is a special terminator reprogrammed to protect John Connor at all costs. They were sent back in time to do such a thing and ends up finding John under attack from the T-1000. They may not be the most advanced of machines, but they were built to learn, becoming a friend of John Connor and potentially learning the value of human life more than humans.

				<p>As a machine, the T-800 may not have an “ordinary world” other than the future one they come from. As such, their call to action happens when the John of the future reprograms their goals and sends them back in time to save John of the past. It can be argued the threshold is crossed not when they are traveling back in time, but when they are told by younger John to learn how human life has value. This is a transition from the robotic world where everything is a direction to a more human world where the robot is asked to think more human and not do what is the easiest path. The trials and challenges happen with the T-1000 trying to kill them as well as how it must convince Sarah how it can act human and be a good companion to John. This culminates in the scene where they fight the T-1000. The T-1000 is bested and in their final act, they destroy themselves to save humanity from the terminators. Thus obtaining their “ultimate boon” in saving John as well as the rest of the human race. This T-800’s journey ends here.
