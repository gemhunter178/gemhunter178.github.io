				<p>BB-8 is a droid in <i>Star Wars VII: The Force Awakens</i>. They are a orange colored droid that rolls on a sphere as a means of movement. They are technically owned or at least assists Poe in his X-wing. They are also given the task to keep the map fragment to Luke Skywalker safe.

				<p>BB-8 starts off in the world of roaming around with Poe. When Poe’s X-wing is destroyed, they are given a call to action as Poe tasks them with keeping the map fragment to Luke Skywalker safe. As such, BB-8 crosses the threshold of being with Poe at all times to wander off on their own in a world unknown to them. Here, they meet Rey, who can be seen as a “meeting with the Goddess” as she protects them, even though Rey could have traded BB-8 for many meals. This leads to the road of trials and challenges as the First Order and their affiliates try to capture BB-8. In finding the resistance and bringing the map fragment to them, they are able to achieve their first goal (and ultimate boon for the film) and return to the service of Poe. Their journey continues in later films.
