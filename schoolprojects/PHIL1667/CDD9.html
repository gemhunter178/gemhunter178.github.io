				<p>David is an android in Ridley Scott’s <i>Prometheus</i>, which is a part of the Alien franchise. It was created by Weyland, who refers to it as the closest thing to a son he will ever have (as such, the pronoun “he” will be used from now on). He is the one who takes care of the expedition and the one who learns about possibly useful information while the humans are in stasis. He does not appear to have any more directive than helping Weyland meet the “Engineers” as he seems to value research and experimentation over the value of human life. That or he also wants to see the end of all humans.

				<p>David starts off in his own world, alone on the ship. His call to action happens as people are waking up and he has to take care of them and update their status. He crosses the threshold by stepping off the world of the ship he has been living on and into a foreign new world. He faces challenges and trials in the form of how humans have a will to live, such as how he wanted Shaw to stay in stasis to transport the alien fetus back to Earth or how he wants to aid Weyland in finding a way to eternal life. In doing this, he finds the “Engineers” to be hostile, and they rip his head off and kill Weyland, which means he failed at one of his goals. As a robotic head, he could still aid Shaw and does so. Shaw brings him along to try to find why the “Engineers” wanted to kill humans and his journey continues.
