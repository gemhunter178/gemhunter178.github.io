				<p>In making this project, I really wanted to make something along the lines of an “interactive essay” in which the user gets to see a little snippet on every journey they go through in this “game.” In doing so, I make have underestimated the scope as even doing this required a large amount of time and a huge amount of dialogue and questions (<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1k4LaRAH6G_rQLezuP3qkFxhEIQdQWBakUpzeFkQKLJs/edit?usp=sharing">see the google document</a>). Even so, I believe I did the best I could for the time allotted.

				<p>In the creation of this game, characters of all the movies watched in class were added based on their importance, weighted by what category I believed they fit into. They were quickly separated into 4 different categories: a low, middle and high class along with an “unknown” for all the robots that do not quite fit any of these categories. Though their positions in their corresponding films, characters were pushed toward one class or another based on money first, and then rank/power. Some characters appear in more than one class due to not being able to really narrow done where they stand or as an interesting addition to make players think. After they were separated on to their own pages, questions were made for each path and linked with an ever expanding amount of questions until all characters were reached. A picture of all of these graphs can be seen to the right (or below if you’re on mobile).<br><br>
This game represents 42 characters from the 7 films we have watched in class. There are over 90 non-character pages dedicated to aid the user in choosing options and describing what to do. The shortest path from the beginning to character is 3 questions, as some people were more “different” and deviated from other characters quickly. The class with the most questions was the Lower class and the one with the least was the “Unknown” class, party due to there being a lack of characters there.<br><br>

				<p>The original project was supposed to span the entire journey of the hero, but, as I was creating options, I quickly realized how many options would need to be done for that. So, this game only covers the first part of the journey, up until crossing the threshold.<br><br>
In addition, original art other than the space image featured in all the pages would have been made, except the large amount of descriptions I had to write took up this time.<br><br>
Oh, and I have barely play tested this, so there may be a few bugs.
