				<p>In making this project, I really wanted to make something along the lines of an “interactive essay” in which the user gets to see a little snippet on every journey they go through in this “game.” In doing so, I make have underestimated the scope as even doing this required a large amount of time and a huge amount of dialogue and questions (see the google document). Even so, I believe I did the best I could for the time allotted.

				<p>In the creation of this game, characters of all the movies watched in class were added based on their importance, weighted by what category I believed they fit into. They were quickly separated into 4 different categories: a low, middle and high class along with an “unknown” for all the robots that do not quite fit any of these categories. Though their positions in their corresponding films, characters were pushed toward one class or another based on money first, and then rank/power. Some characters appear in more than one class due to not being able to really narrow done where they stand or as an interesting addition to make players think. After they were separated on to their own pages, questions were made for each path and linked with an ever expanding amount of questions until all characters were reached. A picture of all of these graphs can be seen to the right.<br><br>
This game represents 42 characters from the 7 films we have watched in class. There are over 90 non-character pages dedicated to aid the user in choosing options and describing what to do. The shortest path from the beginning to character is 3 questions, as some people were more “different” and deviated from other characters quickly. The class with the most questions was the Lower class and the one with the least was the “Unknown” class, party due to there being a lack of characters there.

				<p>It should be noted that the questions on this quiz and their answers reflect my beliefs when the film does not provide a clear black vs. white comparison. One example of this is how some characters sorted into the “high class” may be there because of rank rather than being really high class (they may be middle or high class). In addition, as there is so much content to write about, I may have gotten smaller facts about a character wrong, and the very nature of interpreting their journey is subjective. I apologize in advance for small, but incorrect details. I am willing to discuss any of my decisions.<br>
					Gender of specific character is determined by the actors and actresses that play them in the film, or through context. Robots with no gender are given the pronoun “they”.<br>
Also, due to the volume of this project, some links and choices may be broken. Please alert me if this is the case.
