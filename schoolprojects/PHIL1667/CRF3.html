				<p>Freder is a character from Fritz Lang’s <i>Metropolis</i>. He is the son of Joh Fredersen, who controls the city. As such, he is given everything the high class of the city has to offer. Here, he lives in an “Eternal Garden” where women are “selected” to “entertain” him. One day, he sees a woman leading many children to view the city he lives in. When she is chased away, Freder goes to try to find her as he likes her.

				<p>At first, Freder is in his “normal world” among the high class. He is then called to action when he sees Maria (the girl he saw from far away) as he goes to try to find her. In doing so, he is exposed to the other world of the working class. Here, Freder does not quite refuse the call to action, but instead goes back into his own world to see if anything can be done about it. At his father’s refusal, Freder brings things into his own hands, crossing the threshold by switching places with worker 11811 (Georgy). He then finds Maria who tells him what he must do to mend the “head and the hands”. At this, Freder faces trials and challenges as his father tries to stop him or lead to a more favorable outcome for himself. When the worker’s city is flooding, he had to help Maria in saving the children. He has one final battle with Rotwang when he tries to steal Maria away and he gets his ultimate boon in making Joh and the head worker shake hands with each other. The film ends at this point, but it seems like they are returning back to a new type of normalcy as the mob has calmed down and Joh has shaken hands.
