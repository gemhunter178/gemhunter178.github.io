				<p>Janek is a character from Ridley Scott’s <i>Prometheus</i>, which is a part of the Alien franchise. Janek is the pilot on the expedition led by Elizabeth Shaw and Charlie Holloway. He appears to value doing his job right rather than the outcome of the expedition. He seems to have a romantic interest with Vickers, the leader of the ship in terms of company position. Even with this, he proves to be a formidable fighter when he helps kill the mutated version of Fifield, another member of the expedition team.

				<p>Janek starts off presumably somewhere on Earth. As the pilot of ship, going to the new planet can be the crossing of the threshold for him. In contrast, another journey event can be argued where his “original world” is just piloting the spaceship and relaying information. In this case, the call to action would be Shaw telling him how something must matter to him in some way, and the crossing of the threshold is when he disobeys Vickers in order to save the human race. In this journey, Janek has one big challenge of deciding to successfully target and destroy the “Engineer’s” spaceship, which he does, gaining him the boon of saving something on Earth that he cared about. This action kills him and his journey ends here.
