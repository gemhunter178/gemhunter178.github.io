				<p>Josaphat is a character in Fritz Lang’s <i>Metropolis</i>. He is the assistant of Joh Fredersen, who appears to be strict on him. The events of the film lead Josaphat to lose this job (or worse, as seen by the horror on his face.) Here, he is helped by Freder who collaborates with him to do something.

				<p>Josaphat is brought out of his original world with Joh firing him. The call of action then happens as Freder offered his a way to collaborate in his plan. The threshold is then crossed as Josaphat is now working against Joh (in some way) and is now also presumably lower class than before, which is a big change in the society they live in. He faces trials as Georgy is led astray by temptations and eventually lead the person trailing Freder to his residence. Here, Josaphat tries to keep Freder’s visit a secret, but fails as Georgy’s hat is left out. His fate remains unknown, though it can be presumed a good outcome was reached based on the ending of the film.
