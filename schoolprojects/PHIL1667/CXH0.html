				<p>Hux is a minor character in <i>Star Wars VII: The Force Awakens</i>. He is a general of the First Order and appears to be very supportive of the First Orderâ€™s actions, appearing to preach it to all the Stormtroopers when they destroy the Hosnian system.

				<p>Little is known about Hux from the events portrayed in the film, though he has been rumored to be part of the group that retreated to the unknown regions prior to the film. As such, the emergence of the First Order from this group would be his crossing the threshold - moving from the unknown, secret world back into the world the rest of Star Wars takes place in. His journey continues in the later films.
