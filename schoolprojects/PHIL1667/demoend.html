				<p class="w3-large">A Purely Logical Being</p>
      
				<p>In the film, Spock explains "logic clearly dictates that the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few". As a Vulcan with no emotion or ego, this is what dictates how they act. This is evidenced as he sacrifices himself - exposing himself to deadly levels of radiation - to save the rest of the <i>Enterprise</i>'s crew. Here, his well being is "the few" and the well being of the crew is "the many".</p>
        <p>More evidence of how purely logical he is is exhibited when the <i>Genisis Project</i> is explained as he remains nonchalant about the device's capabilities as, used properly, it would serve the better the many at the cost of the few (the few being unlucky beings that scans did not detect on "lifeless" planets)</p>

			<div class="w3-half">
      
				<p class="w3-large">A Part of a Duo</p>
      
        <p>As explained in Lane Roth's writing, <i>Death and Rebirth in Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan</i>, This film exhibits a <i>"double-hero</i> where Kirk and Spock represent two facets of of one identity. Spock and Kirk are both imperfect in different ways, leading to them walking different metaphorical paths on the same physical journey. Furthermore, in both instances where Spock tells Kirk they are friends, they are shown framed as equals.</p>
        <p>In addition to this, the movie calls upon the book <i>A Tale of Two Cities</i> by Chales Dickens multiple times. In the novel, there is also a double-hero in which one half of the duo dies to save the other half. This reflects how Spock dies to allow Kirk and his crew to live on.</p>
				<p>Note that this is still a demo page and more information will be added.</p>
