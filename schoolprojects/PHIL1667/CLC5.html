				<p>Carol is a character from <i>Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan</i>. She is one of the lead scientists working on Project Genesis. She was romantically involved with Kirk at some time before the film, but has since devoted her life into research. She raises a son, David, who was born from her relationship with Kirk.

				<p>Carol starts off her journey in her “ordinary world” of her lab on Regula I. At first, everything is fine until the crew of <i>Starship Reliant</i> ordered her research was to be taken away from her, under orders from Kirk. She was unwilling to accept this and requests a reason from Kirk. This is her call to action. She then crosses the threshold when she hid the device away in the Genesis cave and away from Khan when she found out Kirk was not behind the potential theft of her research. This transitioned her role as a scientist to one of protecting the universe from Khan, and she entered the world below (the Genesis Cave.) This also became her first trial as she had to actively keep her research out of the wrong hands. Her next trial came when the device was beamed aboard Khan’s <i>Reliant</i> and she had to not be distracted by Kirk, her former lover, who came to save the crew in the cave. Atonement is symbolically achieved by the exiting of the Genesis Cave far below the surface. Her “ultimate boon” is obtained with the Genesis Device working: creating a planet full of life from the nebula. She then continued her research after the film, which is a return back to her “original world.”
