				<p>Elizabeth Shaw is a character from Ridley Scott’s <i>Prometheus</i>, which is a part of the Alien franchise. Along with Charlie Holloway, her lover, she is an archaeologist who finds signs of where humans may have come from based on a certain orientation of stars that appears in their findings across many ancient civilizations. She embarks on a journey to find these so-called “Engineers” that created humans. In the film, there is evidence that she is more cautious and has the skills necessary to survive in a foreign, hostile environment.

				<p>At first, Shaw is seen in her “ordinary world” of archaeology, along with Charlie Holloway. Her call to action happens when she finds another piece of evidence of the star system she had previously found in other expeditions. Unseen in the film, this evidence is enough for Weyland to sponsor a trip to the star system. This journey is a physical representation of her crossing the threshold as she is entering a new world entirely. On this new world, she faces trials and challenges as she discovers the truth that the “Engineers” she was trying to find were trying to end the human race rather than explain why they were made. On this path, many of her companions are killed off until it is just her and the android, David. She continues her journey of seeking answers into the next film.
