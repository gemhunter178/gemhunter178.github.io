				<p>Weyland starts off in the high class, growing old with a lot of money. His call to action is a result of his old age, which makes him seek eternal life. As such he crosses the threshold by secretly joining the expedition to the planet of the “Engineers” in order to ask them how to live forever. His old age provides challenges to this, and he is ultimately killed by the people he wanted to ask, failing his goal and ending his journey.
