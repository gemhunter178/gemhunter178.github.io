				<p>Namgoong is a character from Bong Joon Ho’s <i>Snowpiercer</i>. He is the father of Yona and has knowledge of how to open the doors between the cars of the train (which also figuratively opens doors for the rebellion.) He is addicted to kronole, a highly flammable drug on the train, and does not fluently speak English. He has plans to escape the train instead of taking control of it.

				<p>Namgoong’s original world starts off as the prison compartment that he is trapped in. The call to action happens when Curtis pulls him out of the cell to aid the rebellion. He initially refuses the call, but is brought over by a promise of kronole. He faces the trials with the rebellion as every door he opens leads to a new challenge they must overcome. The “Ultimate Boon” comes as he sacrifices himself to save Yona and Timmy, allowing for some people to escape the train. He does not live to see this.
