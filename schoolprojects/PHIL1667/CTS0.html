				<p>Skynet is a computer system in <i>Terminator 2: Judgement Day</i> as well as in the rest of the franchise. It was made to defend Earth, but, after it gained sentience, decided that humans were in the way of this goal. So, it turned on its creator and is actively trying to destroy humankind. In an attempt to kill off the leader, it has sent back two terminators to try to kill or make sure John Connor, the leader of the resistance against Skynet, never exists.

				<p>Skynet starts off as a computer system designed for defence. Itâ€™s call to action can be argued to be how it was programmed to expand and learn, and it crosses the threshold when humans tried to deactivate it as it switched from trying to defend people into trying to defend itself. It faces a series of challenges and trials as the humans it is trying to destroy prove resilient and survive on. In the film, Skynet is eliminated from the T2 timeline as the computer lab it was being made in was destroyed. In alternate timelines, it continues its journey.
