				<p>Ava is an android in Alex Garland’s <i>Ex Machina</i>. They were developed by Nathan of Blue Book and is fully capable of imitating human ability, going as far as to emotionally deceive Caleb into freeing them. They appear to hate Nathan for their imprisonment, but, do not seem to hate other humans based on their interactions (or lack thereof) with the people walking on the crosswalk. They seem to have an interest with a previous version, Kyoko, based on Ava’s first actions outside of the cell they were contained in.

				<p>Ava starts off in the world of Nathan with nobody else. The call to action happens when Caleb shows up as, unlike Nathan, Caleb has the potential to be tricked into letting them escape. Ava crosses the threshold when they turn off the power for the first time in front of Caleb, allowing for a private conversation outside of Nathan’s world or surveillance. They then face challenges and trials in the form of convincing Caleb to do their bidding and help it escape. Here is the apotheosis, where they understand Caleb is someone who can be manipulated, and they use this. Once this is achieved, the final trial happens as they face their creator, Nathan, and what to do with Caleb. In leaving behind Caleb and reaching the crosswalk, they obtain the ultimate boon by becoming indistinguishable from humans as well as being free. Ava’s journey ends with her returning to the world of humans as a human.
