				<p>In the film, Poe is already past the call to action as he is working with the resistance. It can be argued that the call to action happens with his capture on Jakku as he is pulled away from his “ordinary world” of doing missions with the rebellion into a world where he must fight more actively. The threshold is crossed when he works with Finn to escape the first order, landing him back on Jakku with someone he just met. The film then does not show him for a while, but, when he is seen again, he is in the challenges and trials phase of the journey. In this phase, he is fighting TIE fighters and, later on, Starkiller Base. He continues his journey into the next movies.
