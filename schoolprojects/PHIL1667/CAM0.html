				<p>In the film, Maria starts off in her own world among the working class. The call to adventure happens sometime before the film as she is made the leader of the movement. She crosses the threshold by taking up the call and becoming the leader of the movement. Her trials come as she tries to keep peace and how she is trapped by Rotwang, who impersonates her through his “Machine Man.” Her image is then used against her as the “Machine Man” instils violence amongst the working class. She gets help from Freder and the ordeal comes to the “Ultimate boon” as she is nearly killed, but then finally achieves her goal by having Freder facilitate Joh shaking hands with the head worker.</p>
