				<p>Kyoko is an android in Alex Garlandâ€™s <i>Ex Machina</i>. They are an earlier version of an android created by Nathan and serve as a servant to him. Kyoko is allegedly not fluent in English and appears to be constantly used/abused by Nathan. Unlike Ava, Kyoko is free to roam around the laboratory, though they are usually seen with or aiding Nathan in some way.

				<p>Kyoko starts off in their mental world of only helping Nathan around. For most of the film, they remain like this, though it can be argued that they are trying to show Caleb what is wrong in this lab. This could be the call to action as they realize Caleb may react differently than Nathan, perhaps allowing them to get their message out that they are abused. The threshold in this case is crossed when Kyoko shows how they are a robot to Caleb, who was also watching Nathan abuse previous versions of androids and how he stuffed them into his closet. Then they are presented with the trials and challenges of trying to escape, presumably with Ava. Here, Kyoko is presumably wounded beyond repair by Nathan and their journey ends here.
