				<p>Leia or General Leia (formerly Princess Leia) is a character in <i>Star Wars VII: The Force Awakens</i> as well as a large part of the <i>Star Wars</i> franchise. She is one of the leaders of the resistance in the film, and a former lover of Han Solo (as well as Luke Skywalker). She is the mother of Kylo Ren. She also seems to interact with C-3PO a good amount as C-3PO is the first to introduce her when she lands near Maz’s temple.

				<p>In this film, Leia starts off already in the resistance. Her call to action for this film could be argued to be the assault on Maz’s Temple, as she probably knew of the important artifact(s), such as Luke’s lightsaber, kept there. This brings her back into the world of Han Solo and the newfound team, which is crossing the threshold into a world she knew before in a way. As she is one of the leaders of the resistance, their challenges and trials, such as the destructive power of Starkiller Base, becomes the challenges and trials she faces in her journey. A temptation comes in the form of trying to stop Han from trying to convince “Ben” to stop his evil ways, but she lets it pass, knowing she has other duties to fulfill. She has obtained the boon of this film in destroying Starkiller Base, but her journey continues into the next films.
