				<p>Vickers is a character in Ridley Scott’s <i>Prometheus</i>. She is the leader of the expedition shown in the film on a business standpoint. She appears to despise the fact that Shaw and Holloway were named the leader of the expedition by Weyland. She also appears to want to stay living in a life of luxury. She does have a night with Janek the pilot though, and may be the daughter of Weyland.

				<p>Vickers is part of the Weyland Corporation business and may be pretty high up due to how she was the only human member of the Corporation selected to be part of the expedition. The call to action happens as she did not want to remain in a boardroom, waiting for something good to happen to her. As such, her leaving the planet on the expedition becomes the crossing of the threshold as she moves to a new world. Then, she faces the challenges of trying to assert her power against the rest of the team and ultimately fails as there is no one left to control except maybe Shaw. She also fails to hold her luxury lifestyle as the escape pod was ruined when it crash landed. She also died in running away from the “Engineer’s” ship, where she gets crushed, ending her journey.
