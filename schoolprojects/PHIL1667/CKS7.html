				<p>Spock is a character in <i>Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan</i> as well as a large part of the <i>Star Trek</i> franchise. He is half Vulcan and half Human and is high ranking at his post in <i>Starship Enterprise</i>. He is a friend of Kirk, the main protagonist and commander of the film, and aids in many decisions. He is a very logical being due to his Vulcan heritage.

				<p>Spock starts off in his “ordinary world” of duties in Starfleet, including being part of the <i>Enterprise</i>’s crew. In Star Trek II, his call of action is the same as the other members of the crew as Kirk orders them to find out what is happening at Regula I and the status of the genesis device. Upon crossing the threshold by journeying there, he faces the challenges and trials the Khan has placed on the crew. This then leads to a final act where Spock saves the rest of the crew in sacrificing himself through subjecting his body to large doses of radiation. This lets Spock obtain the boon of his phrase “the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few.” Even though he is presumed dead in this film, his journey does continue as more movies are added to the franchise.
