				<p>John Connor is a character in <i>Terminator 2: Judgement Day</i> as well as some other films of the franchise. He is the future leader of the human resistance against Skynet and its creations. In T2 he is a smart child as he is able to steal money from ATMs with a device he made. As evidenced from using this money to go to the arcade, he enjoys having fun and ignoring his foster parents. He believes his mom, Sarah Connor, has a mental problem, much like the rest of the asylum she is in.

				<p>John starts off in his “original world,” playing with his friends and riding a dirt motorbike. His call to action happens suddenly when the T-1000 sent to kill him finds him at the same time as the T-800 sent to protect him. Here, he wants to refuse the call and go back to his foster parents instead of following the T-800. With the death of his foster parents at the hand of the T-1000, he is guided back onto the path. John crosses the threshold when he tries to teach the T-800 the value of human life, fully accepting and trying to control the predicament. The T-1000 as well as local law enforcement then continues to bring challenges to the team. The final challenge occurs at a steel working facility when they face off with the T-1000. The ultimate boon is obtained when they defeat the T-1000. As he has gotten to know the T-800, John then refuses to return to the “ordinary world” as he wants the T-800 to stay even though it could put many lives at risk. The rescue from this is aided by both his mom and the T-800 as they know it is the right thing to do in destroying the T-800. John then crosses the return threshold until the next film.
