				<p>This is a game/quiz I made as a creative final for PHIL-1667.<br><br> The point of this game/quiz is to show how real heroes and fictional ones can relate to the Hero’s Journey as described by Joseph Campbell. In writing out paths for many (42) of the characters seen in the films we have watched, and a brief overview of how their story relates to the Hero’s Journey. The purpose of the game/quiz format is to provide a platform for players/users to relate the character they have in their head to the one that they ultimately choose. It is to make them think whether or not they agree that this character really experiences a similar path as the one given after they answer questions.

				<p>In the creation of this game, characters of all the movies watched in class were added based on their importance, weighted by what category I believed they fit into. They were quickly separated into 4 different categories: a low, middle and high class along with an “unknown” for all the robots that do not quite fit any of these categories. Though their positions in their corresponding films, characters were pushed toward one class or another based on money first, and then rank/power. Some characters appear in more than one class due to not being able to really narrow done where they stand or as an interesting addition to make players think. After they were separated on to their own pages, questions were made for each path and linked with an ever expanding amount of questions until all characters were reached. A picture of all of these graphs can be seen in the behind the scenes page.<br><br>
        This game represents 42 characters from the 7 films we have watched in class. There are over 90 non-character pages dedicated to aid the user in choosing options and describing what to do. The shortest path from the beginning to character is 3 questions, as some people were more “different” and deviated from other characters quickly. The class with the most questions was the Lower class and the one with the least was the “Unknown” class, party due to there being a lack of characters there. The button below brings you to a full Google Document with almost all of this writing and planning.
