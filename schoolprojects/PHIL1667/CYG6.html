				<p>As little is known about Georgy, a large part of his journey is missing. Georgy is living in his original world of working the machine. The call happens when Freder meets him and switches places. He faces temptations in the world of the high class and succumbs to this. He does not get to atone with anyone as he is pulled out by the man sent to follow Freder around.
