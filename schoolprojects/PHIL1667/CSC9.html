				<p>Curtis is a character in Bong Joon Ho’s <i>Snowpiercer</i>. He is the actual leader of the rebellion as he plans and gives the call when to initiate the attack. Unlike some of the other characters on the train, Curtis has lived 17 years on the ground and 17 years on the train. He is a tail car passenger, making him part of the lower class in this society.

				<p>Curtis starts out in his “ordinary world” of the tail car of the train. His call to action happens before the movie starts as he is already planning how to escape and rebel against the people in the cars ahead. The “Belly of the Whale” phase of the Hero’s Journey happens with the freezing of Andrew’s arm as it is the last bit of separation before Curtis crosses the threshold and goes into his trials. The threshold is crossed when the rebellion starts and they make it into the next car. Here on out the rebellion faces trials as they make their way through the train. Curtis does meet a sort of a temptress on the way as he is given the option to take over the train and does not immediately eliminate the idea. Then, as the train is falling apart, he reaches the “Apotheosis” stage where he realizes this is how the train operates and in order to stop the cycle, he must stop the train. The Ultimate Boon is reached as he rescues and protects Yona and Timmy for them to live on, off of the train.
