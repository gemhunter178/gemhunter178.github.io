				<p>Khan Noonien Singh is a character in <i>Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan</i> as well as some other parts of the franchise. He is a genetically modified human who was brought out of stasis by Kirk and his crew. Following an attempted mutiny aboard <i>Starship Enterprise</i>, Khan is forced into exile on Ceti Alpha V and has lived there since… until <i>Starship Reliant</i> sent down a scouting party.

				<p>Khan literally and figuratively leaves his “original world” in getting off it and onto <i>Starship Reliant</i>. As such, the call to action for Khan is the appearance of the scouting party, which gave him a chance to escape exile. He crosses the threshold by taking over <i>Reliant</i> and targeting the Genesis device being researched at Regula I. Challenges and trials for Khan occur as he tries to best Kirk with his “superior intellect.” He ultimately fails as he is lured into the temptation of finally killing Kirk rather than leaving with the Genesis device.
