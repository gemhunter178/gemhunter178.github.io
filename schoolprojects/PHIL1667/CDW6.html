				<p>Wilford is a character from Bong Joon Ho’s <i>Snowpiercer</i>. He is the inventor and head of the train that the movie is mostly set in. Here, he sits and eats mostly in isolation from the rest of the train, except when he needs a special “product” as indicated when he had two children brought up to replace “broken parts” in the train. He is the one responsible for keeping rebellions to kill off a certain amount of people on the train and “rebalance” society.

				<p>Wilford starts in the world of the engine room of the car. His call to action happens when he realizes he is getting old and also how the train is in need of another “rebalancing” rebellion. Here, he refuses the call of being old as he never wanted the rebellion to make it past the axe men at the bridge scene. When Curtis defeats this force, Wilford is forced to cross the threshold and accept that he might need someone to replace him once he dies. As such, he throws some more obstacles at Curtis and, when he makes it to the engine room, invites him in for a talk about his plans. In contrast to accepting and becoming head of the train, Wilford does not get his final goal fulfilled as he goes down with the train when it derails.This ends Wilford’s Journey.
