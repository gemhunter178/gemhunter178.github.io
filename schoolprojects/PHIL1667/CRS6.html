				<p>Sarah Connor is a character in <i>Terminator 2: Judgement Day</i> as well as many of the other films of the franchise. She is the mother of John Connor and is the primary target of the terminator sent back in time in the first Terminator film. In this film, she has been locked in a mental hospital due to her talks about “Judgement Day,” which no one but her believes, including her son.

				<p>In T2, Sarah starts off in her “original world” of the mental institution. The call to action happens before the events of the film as she knows of the coming “Judgement Day.” As such, this makes her very weary of her son’s well-being, and the fact that she is mistreated and abused in the mental hospital gives another reason to try to escape. Her escape then becomes the crossing of the threshold as she exits the world of the hospital into the rest of reality. It is at this time that she finds John being chased by one terminator, and protected by another. She faces challenges and trials in trying to stop Judgement Day from happening, including being tempted by the possibility to change fate by killing Miles Bennet, the primary developer behind what would become Skynet. She reaches atonement as she can not finish the job, realizing and understanding that this action may make her no better than a terminator. She obtains her “ultimate boon” as she destroys all evidence of the terminators (with the exception of T-800’s arm in the machinery) and the possibility of Skynet being rebuilt. The film ends with her driving a road, which would be the return to the “normal world.”
