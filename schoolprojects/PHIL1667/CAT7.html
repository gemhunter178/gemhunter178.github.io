				<p>In the beginning, Tanya is in her own world in the tail car of the train. She gets a call of action before the events of the film as she is already working with Curtis to some extent, helping them find the next capsule with the red note. In this case, she has already met the mentor, as Curtis is guiding them all into the next phase of crossing the threshold. The threshold is then crossed figuratively and literally with the escape from the tail car, starting the rebellion. Tanya then faces trials as she tries to find her son, and is killed in one of the trials. Before this happens, her association with Curtis allows her to achieve the goal of keeping Timmy safe.</p>
