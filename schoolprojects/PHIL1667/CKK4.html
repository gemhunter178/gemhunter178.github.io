				<p>Captain James T. Kirk is a character in <i>Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan</i> as well as most of the <i>Star Trek Franchise</i>. He is the captain of <i>Starship Enterprise</i> and has become friends with many of the crew members. He was the former lover of Carol, who is one of the lead scientists developing the Genesis Device. Prior to this film, Kirk had found a ship filled of genetically modified humans, one of which he brought out of stasis. This person, named Khan, then does on to try to take over the ship and fails. As such, Kirk has exiled Khan to live on Ceti Alpha V, a planet.

				<p>Khan starts in his world in Starfleet, commanding and exploring with the <i>Enterprise</i>. A call to action happens when the Genesis Project team calls him and tells of how he commanded the research be handed over. Sensing trouble, Kirk must investigate and does so with a crew of experienced and trainee people. Voyaging to Regula I becomes the crossing of the threshold as they move to a new planet. Here, he discovers Khan is behind all of this and he then faces challenges and trials brought upon him by Khan. In this, he meets up again with Carol, who somewhat becomes the temptress of the story as he takes some time to remark on how good they were together. A final challenge occurs as a battle between Khan and Kirk on their starships, where Khan loses and is absorbed into the new planet the Genesis Device has created. This becomes the ultimate boon of Kirk as he has finally triumphed over Khan. The crew then has a problem in returning to their original world as Spock is no longer with them. The final scene with narration from Kirk shows that they have gone back to the normal world.
