				<p>Kylo Ren or “Ben” is a character from <i>Star Wars VII: The Force Awakens</i>. He is working under Supreme Leader Snoke as a member of the First Order in the film. He is the one responsible for the destruction of the planets in the Hosnian system, leaving the resistance without a official governing body. He does not take kindly to talks against him as shown in his interactions with Hux and Han Solo. He is also the son of Han Solo and Princess Leia.

				<p>Kylo starts off in his normal “terrorizing people” role on the lookout for Luke as well as following in Darth Vader’s footsteps. In this film, his call to action occurs when BB-8 escapes with the map fragment to find Luke Skywalker. This prompts him to comb the galaxy for the droid, crossing the threshold out of just ruling and having power over people. In this pursuit, he is driven off the path a few times by capturing people he would believe he could get the information out of, rather than actually finding and/or destroying the droid. He faces trials and challenges in the form of the resistance attacking the First Order’s assets. In one of his challenges, Han Solo comes to meet him face to face and try to talk him out of the path he walks. Kylo then indirectly leads to the destruction of Starkiller Base as Chewbacca goes into a rampage as Kylo kills Han, who was Chewie’s friend. Chewbacca in their rage destroys enough of the oscillator for the fighter squadrons to finish off the job and destroy the base. Kylo’s journey continues into the next movies.
