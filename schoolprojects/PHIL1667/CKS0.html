				<p>Saavik is a character from <i>Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan</i> as well as a few other parts of the <i>Star Trek</i> franchise. She is half Vulcan and half Romulan, leading her to also be very logical in decisions. She is a trainee in the events of the film, only taking a voyage on the <i>Enterprise</i> due to a lack of crew. She is annoyed by the fact that the Kobayashi Maru simulation has no way of winning without altering it. She proves to be very intelligent, memorizing many of the Starfleet codes.

			<div class="w3-full">
       
				<p>Saavik starts off in her “ordinary world” of a trainee in Starfleet. Much like the rest of the crew in the film, her call to action happens when Kirk needs to investigate Regula I and the status of the Genesis Device. As they do not have enough crew to operate, trainees like Saavik were brought on board to help. On the voyage, she faces the trials and challenges brought upon them by Khan. Here, she was part of the “boarding crew” that was beamed down to the lab to find out what happened, straying from their other goal of stopping Khan. Here, she gets a greater understanding of how a no-win scenario can be beat, though she does not like the answer. She does not appear for much of the rest of the film, other than at Spock’s funeral. Her appearance in the next film suggests she is still continuing her journey.
