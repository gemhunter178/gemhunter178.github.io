				<p>Caleb is a character in Alex Garland’s <i>Ex Machina</i>. He is a programmer working for a search engine company known as Blue Book. In the events of the film, he wins a contest to visit the house of the CEO for a week. At this house, he is tasked with determining if Ava, an android that Nathan (the CEO) has developed, passes the ultimate Turing Test. Caleb finds himself questioning what actions are right and what it means to be human around a person who does not seem to care about his creations at an emotional level.

			<div class="w3-full">
       
				<p>Caleb starts off in his world at the office as a programmer. His call to action becomes the moment when he wins the contest and will get to spend a week at the home of the CEO of the company (Nathan’s house.) A physical threshold is crossed as he takes a helicopter away from the office and into Nathan’s house. Caleb experiences a brief refusal of the call when Nathan places a non-disclosure contract in front of him to sign. With some hesitation, Caleb finally signs, crossing another threshold as he cannot unlearn the fact that Nathan has created AI that may be indistinguishable from humans. Knowing this, Caleb is forced into challenges and trials as he finds out how much he can relate to the androids, and how badly Nathan is treating something that he can perceive as human. Along this path, Nathan is constantly tempting him to go along with his plan of keeping the androids secret and allowing him to develop them further. Instead, Caleb outsmarts Nathan and ends up freeing Ava, which could be Caleb obtaining his “Ultimate Boon” of freeing something that should be free (to his eyes.) In doing so, he gets trapped in Nathan’s room by Ava, arguably bringing him back to the original world of being stuck in a box, much like work.
