				<p>Gilliam, a character from Bong Joon-ho’s <i>Snowpiercer</i>. He is in the tail car of the train in the movie, along with the rest of the lower class. Instead of only being part of the lower class, he has a secret tie with Wilford, the owner and operator of the train and society within it. I will not that there is an argument against this, but we will assume this is true for the sake of this “game.”</p>

				<p>Gilliam Starts off in his ordinary world amongst the lower class in the tail car. He is called to action when Curtis asks him to lead after they get to the engine car. Initially, he refuses as he wants Curtis to be the leader, but, after seeing some of the horrors that Wilford was supporting, he yells t talk to him and change something. Instead of achieving his goal, Gilliam’s Journey ends here as he is shot in the head as a message to Curtis.</p>
