				<p>Nathan is a character from Alex Garland’s <i>Ex Machina</i>. He is the CEO of Blue Book, a search engine company. He has developed intelligent androids that match the capabilities of humans. In trying to test the capabilities of his creation, he targets a person who was “a good kid” through his power with the data he has access to. As such, Caleb is selected to test the androids. He appears to want to become buddies with Caleb and seems to have an alcohol problem.

				<p>At the start, Nathan is by himself in his lab, creating androids. His call to action happens when he believes it was time for someone else to know about the androids and to test them against someone who was not him. As such, he sends out the invitation disguised as winning a contest. The threshold is cross when Caleb arrives and sees the androids as there is no turning back into his “normal” lab world anymore. The trials and challenges he faces was to try to connect to Caleb to make sure he did not do anything funny as well as a fight he had with himself. This internal fight is indicated by the amount of drinking he does and how he tries to atone for it with exercise and health foods and can be seen as the temptress as well as him seeking atonement. His final challenge arrives when Caleb successfully released the most advanced android, Ava. Along with Kyoko, Nathan is bested and killed, and his journey ends there.
