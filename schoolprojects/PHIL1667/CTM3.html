				<p>Miles Bennet Dyson is a character from <i>Terminator 2: Judgement Day</i>. He is a cybernetics scientist and high up among his employees at Cyberdyne Systems Corporation. If the events of T2 did not occur, he would be the inventor of the neural-net processor that leads to the development of Skynet. Instead, after an interaction with Sarah Connor, he realizes how dangerous his research would be, and goes to destroy it with them.

				<p>Miles starts off with his “ordinary world” working at Cyberdyne Systems Corporation. His initial call to action is one that leads him to want to develop the systems that would create Skynet. This call to action would happen before the film as the discovery of the terminator parts from the first film. The second (and more important for this film) call to action happens when Miles is almost assassinated by Sarah Connor. It is here that he somehow gets swayed to destroy his life’s work. The threshold is crossed by him when they lead an assault on the computer lab he is a part of. Here, he crosses from being a creator of the technology into a destroyer. The challenges and trials faced are presented as the locking systems and safeguards he had put in place when he was making the technology. His “ultimate boon” is obtained as he blows up the lab in his dying act. His journey ends here.
