				<p>Han Solo is a character from <i>Star Wars VII: The Force Awakens</i> as well as many other films in the franchise. He is the father of Kylo and a close friend of Chewbacca. He is arguably the primary owner of the <i>Millenium Falcon</i>, which he used to use for smuggling things, which is a job he still did.

				<p>Han Solo, in this film, starts of smuggling things as usual. He is then called to action as he finds his old ship the <i>Millennium Falcon</i> as other bounty hunters find him as well as the droid that the First Order was looking for (BB-8). It appears he initially refused the call as he was more interested in his smuggled goods rather than returning to Leia. A push to cross the threshold then happens as Maz’s temple is attacked, and Leia shows up, forcing an interaction between the two. He then crosses the threshold by joining the cause again. He then faces trials and challenges as the aids the attack on Starkiller Base. A final challenge occurs when he tries to convince Kylo (Ben) back to at least be family. Here, he fails, is killed, and gets thrown into a deep pit. This ends Han’s journey.
