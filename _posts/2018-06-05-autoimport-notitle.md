After 2 flights, 1 bus ride, and multiple naps during this journey, I am posting from Sheffield, UK.
      

Before I go any further, I'd like to note that I am exhausted. What follows will probably be a stream of random thoughts.
      

Anyways, I've already gone and had "dinner" at Gourmet Burger Kitchen, which had a really amazing burger. On the same walk, I realized there's a Caff√® Nero here so things will be OK. There was also the Moor Market, which reminded me of the markets seen in some parts of Asia- even with the authentic smell of fish markets. The floors weren't dirt though.
      

Afterwards, we went to the local supermarket and got some "weird" crisp (chip) flavors. Planning on having them soon. Oh, everyone here has that adorable English accent (though we're the one with accents here).
      

This is as much as my beleaguered mind is willing to write right now. Post some other day.
