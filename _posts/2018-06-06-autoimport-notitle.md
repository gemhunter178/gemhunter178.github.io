Well, I've only been here for about a day, but I do have to say I like the height of this city.
      

I know this country is notorious for gray skies, but I do hope it clears someday so I can see the stars (if light pollution doesn't ruin that).
      

There are so many little stores here, and, if anyone has seen the random woodwork I do, so many new types of trees (I value living ones more though, but if someone has a cut down log, that'd be cool). Also, everything here is like oak. Kinda boring, but, at least a lot of it is also solid.
      

So, <a href="https://sheffdocfest.com/" target="_blank">Docfest</a> starts tomorrow. Gotta plan out what I want to do. I already got my pass. The selection is overwhelming though.
      

At this point I'm missing home, being across the pond. I have so much plans when I get back already.
