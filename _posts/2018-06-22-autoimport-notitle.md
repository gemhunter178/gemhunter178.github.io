So, it's very late here, so, I'll keep this short. 
      

Yesterday, most of the day was spent at the Château de Versailles, but we did go to the Arc de Triomphe as well. Today we went to the Musée d’Orsay, shopping, and then ended up climbing to the 2nd floor and riding the elevator up to the third floor of the Eiffel Tower. This also explains my late post. We were up there past midnight.
      

Anyways, I might post some extra pictures of these journeys when I get the time. For the time being, you can click on that image above for a picture I took up there.
      

It's even later than the last post. G'night!
