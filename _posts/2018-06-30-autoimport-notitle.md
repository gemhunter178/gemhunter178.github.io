So, yesterday I went to a friend of mine's house. He cabs (makes those round, dome-shaped gems) stones. Anyways, I had some Koroit opal I bought last year. I learned how to finish them.
      

Cutting these things seem easier than I though it would. It's like polishing a tiny, hard piece of wood. Of course the tools used are different, but, it's fundamentally the same.
      

Perhaps I should polish some valuable wood scraps the same way. I do have some snakewood lying around somewhere.
      

Anyways, I'll probably go back sometime soon and finish off cutting these. (I still have some more material). Who knows what I'll get.
