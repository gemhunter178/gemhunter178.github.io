subtitle: One of the most busy days I'll have (hopefully)
---

“Wake up, no, seriously, wake up.” I told myself. It was 6:30AM (My usual wake-up time). With a grunt, I hauled myself out of bed. I was honestly dreading today. Today was the day we were supposed to make profiles of people in the city.

Strangers, for now?

I got dressed and sat around, waiting for 7:30 when breakfast starts. To pass the time, I put my computer near the door (the WiFi in my room kinda sucks) and watched a few YouTube videos. This usually made the time pass by real fast, but, today the passing of time was so slow it was almost palpable. One video finished, then I watched another… finally, it was time to get breakfast. I went downstairs to find….another mediocre selection of food. Sure, I can’t complain that it’s included with our lodging, but I do wish it was slightly better or had more options. I quickly finished breakfast and went back upstairs to my room, storing the leftover food I “stole” into the refrigerator. Then I organized the equipment needed today (by that I mean I moved around things to keep my mind off of what I had to do).

Time passed. 8:25. My group texted me. It was time to go.

We started by walking toward Riverdale Farm– perhaps we could find some farm hand or city worker to make a profile/short interview on. Before we walked 2 blocks, we saw a city worker as we passed by Alan Gardens, maybe we could interview her?

We were hesitant. “Go do it.” it was my thoughts again. “You could get it over with.” I nervously walked over.

“Hello”

She took notice. I repeated myself-

“Hello, we’re students from America working on a project and I was wondering it I could interview you and talk about Toronto…”

She agreed to be filmed. One of my stressed nerves relaxed.

Soon enough, half and hour later, after talking and filming for nearly the same amount of time, she had to go to her break. I was done…for now. That was easier than I thought.

After that, my morning went pretty quickly. I knew I had a large amount of content to edit, but, at least I was done for now. We stopped by a dance studio in Cabbagetown to get another interview. Somehow right after we finished filming the second interview, we filled up the camera SD card. We just had too much footage! That was unexpected. We had to head back to borrow my other SD card. So, we did.

At this point, we still had one interview to go. So, we walked out and found a taco restaurant that wasn’t open yet… but hey, they let us interview them! 11:15. We were well ahead of schedule, so we went back to our building to transfer our footage. This is when many of my nerves tensed up and tied themselves into a knot.

42GB. I had 42GB of footage. That is not going to be fun to edit down to 2 minutes, nor was the transfer time pretty (estimated 40 minutes). My day also didn’t get much better after that. I transferred all the files before class into an external hard drive…then, after getting to class, I realized I forgot the power cable for my drive. It was a good 20 minute walk one way to the classroom. It took me 35 minutes – running – to get my power cable. Now, I had about 1/2 an hour of video…and I was ~40 minutes behind. My stomach turned a little. I was starting to go dizzy a little bit. This was due tomorrow! I had to get this done…along with a Blog Post! So, I did what I could do: sit down and edit and edit and edit. Soon it was time to leave class. 6:00PM.

On the way back, we went to the taco place from this morning. I took dinner as an opportunity to get one last break. What did I do with this break? YouTube.

7:00PM. Break went by too fast. Just to ease part of my mind, I told myself I would not go shower until I at least finished one of the items on my agenda. The blog post seemed easier… so I did that. I still have a night of video editing ahead.

8:30PM. I get to shower.
