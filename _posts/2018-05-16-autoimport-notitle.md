Before I say anything, today will be a test of a longer blog post and functionality with this. Ok, that being said, today we were teamed up into partners and then sent off to take a dérive in a location. My group was assigned to [Riverdale Farm](http://riverdalefarmtoronto.ca/).

So, what we did was we bought a Presto card and made our way to the Parliament St. stop in Toronto. The streetcar that was supposed to bring us there was actually not operational with the repairs/maintenance going on in Cabbagetown, so, we got dropped off a bit farther off than expected. The neightborhood to the Farm was nice: older styled, close, buildings.

Once at the Farm, the first thing we noticed was the farm smell: a mix of hay and animals. This was indeed an actual farm this close to downtown! We spent about 2 hours wandering about and taking it in. At first we followed animal sightings and sounds, like little kids would. Then, we took whatever paths we have not taken yet.

Overall, I would like to go back someday, perhaps take a few pictures (we were instructed not to do so) and explore the neighboring park and Cabbagetown. Definitely worth a trip if you have a few hours to spend!
