So, today is Victoria Day in Canada, almost every store is closed. Yet, there we were, stuck in the same classroom. Heck. the elevator <i>and</i> the classroom had to be openned by security. Th very building itself didn't want us in it.

Yet, we were there... looking at the same unmoving skyline that we have been staring at for the past week. The air conditioning was off. We relocated to the middle room just to be cooler.

Actually, I kinda liked that arrangement- everyone sprawled around sitting at tables or single chairs with little organization.

12:30PM: At lunch, we had to make do with what stores were open. I found myself in a Tim Horton's asking for a chicken sandwich (which was better than I expected, not sponsored). Heading back to our classroom, it was the same as earlier: ask security, get on the elevator, get locked out, great. Luckily we left someone in the room to open the door. Lunch passed too fast. It was class again.

Now time passed slowly, as if it was a naughtly child doing the opposite of what it was told. Somehow, we got through it. Today was not the most exciting day. Perhaps there will be fireworks tonight? Eh, class is making me too tired to put in the effort. I guess I'll just do my blog post.
