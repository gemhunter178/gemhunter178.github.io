So, <a href="https://sheffdocfest.com/" target="_blank">Docfest</a> started today...
      

I was prepared to sign up for AR/VR things today, but aparently they're having technical difficulties. I did manage to be first in line for <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/250162182217763/" target="_blank">Doublethink</a>. Of course, I chose HOPE for that. I think they did it justice. It was very immersive, especially for a flat screen. Also today, I got to go see <a href="http://braincontrolledmovie.co.uk/" target="_blank">The Moment</a> as a viwer (it's cool since one person is he "driver" and controls the movie by their brain). Can't say I'd like it in a traditional sense, but the technology is interesting and shows high potential.
      

That's all from me today. Gotta be in line for AR/VR stuff tomorrow!
