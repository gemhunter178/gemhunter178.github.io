These few days in Paris will be very "tourist-y". Anyways, I've been wandering around the city, doing things. Yesterday, we went to the Notre-Dame de Paris, then the Jardin du Luxembourg and finally the Jardin des plantes. We also stopped at the Panth√©on and also Les Invalides at some point. Today, we spent most of our time at the Louvre, but we also got to see the Place de la Concorde.
      

Out of all these places, I actually liked the Jardin des plantes as it is a botanitcal garden and I like that type of stuff. Too bad the greenhouses weren't open. To addto that, they had a giant smokey quartz cluster in front of one of the natural history museums. I didn't get to go in (closed), but love that type of stuff too.
      

Almost everywhere here is so pretty though. Very impressive building sizes, architecture and whatnot. It's amazing what people were able to accomplish hundreds of years ago (in some cases).
      

Today, most of my time was spent the the Louvre. I walked all day and still I didn't get to see everything. At least I went somewhat early, so I actually got a decent view/picture of the Mona Lisa. So many works in this gallery/palace are impressive. Would not mind going another dy...if I had the time.
      

Friday will be a shopping day. Can't wait to get my fiends back at home and I some stuff. Hopefully we'll avoid the tourist traps for this one.
      

Anyways, tomorrow is another adventure. We're 6 hours ahead of my hometown. G'night!
