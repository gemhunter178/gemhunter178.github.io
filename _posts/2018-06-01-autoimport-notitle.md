Today, the class went to the <a href="http://onf-nfb.gc.ca/en/produce-with-the-nfb/our-studios/ontario-centre-english/" target="_blank">National Film Board of Canada, Ontario Studio</a>, where we saw some of the process of making their films. I think we went because we got to test out some experimental documentaries in VR that they had. Very cool!
      

So, about the picture for today... I did get a picture in the studio, but I'm not sure if I'm allowed to post it. So, here's a picture I got roaming around today.
      

Anyways, if anyone wants to test something we tried out, I think I'm allowed to link <a href="http://a-way-to-go.com/" target="_blank">this</a> one.
      

After our field trip, the rest of the day was spent walking around with my team and getting some 360Â° video shots. It was especially fun when we tacked on a sign reading "Look here" onto the camera. A surprising amount of people were curious and helped out with our shots. Thank you if you're reading this!
