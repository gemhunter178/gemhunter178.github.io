Today, after another 9 to 11AM check in with where we are on our projects, our group decided to stay at the class space to work on things.
      

Normally, there wouldn't be a problem....except I left my laptop charger back in my room as I thought we were heading back afterward. So, I did as much as my battery life would allow me to do while also waiting on the team to finish communicating and getting assests to the app developer we are working with.
      

Sure enough, we were still troubleshooting when my computer decided to shut off. Sucks that my laptop uses the USB-C port to charge. So, I waited around for another 20 minutes watching videos on my phone. I would cost less/take less time to our location if I stayed. Then, at some point, my team suggested I go back, grab the charger, and come back if time permits.
      

It did not.
      

My team sent me a message after I just got back to the living area. They said not to bother coming back as they left for our shooting location.
      

Time passed decently fast today. Now it's 11:30PM and I am tired.
      

I should probably go to bed...
