Not sure if I'm going to make a super long post today, but, I'll leave the button below in for testing purposes. Today was a decently long day of class. Heck, we basically went 9AM-6PM (with a lunch break of course)

If you're reading this, then my external extend page is working! I do have to note that I'll probably update and develop the blog further once given the chance. These pages are to remain on for legacy though.

Back to the review we had today: Today we reviewed camera and audio equipment and how to use Premiere and Photoshop. I was expecting Premiere to be like Lightworks, which I have used before. I was right, but I also realized I need to relearn a lot of things.

Anyways, that's all from me tonight. I gotta go to bed. Tomorrow we'll be filming profiles on strangers (with permission).
