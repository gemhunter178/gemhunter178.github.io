I'm aware I didn't manage to get a post out yesterday... I had to get the 18th's post up first. You can also find that post at <a href="https://web.northeastern.edu/ar-doc/2018/05/18/day-4-talking-to-strangers/">https://web.northeastern.edu/ar-doc/2018/05/18/day-4-talking-to-strangers/</a>. There you can also find other posts from our trip!

Ok, anyway. I might either take a break today.... or finally get to making more art for the website. Time will tell.

Anyways, I should get on track to doing some of those things. I may or may not update this post later...

Ok, I'm back. Today we went to the <a href="https://www.toronto.ca/explore-enjoy/parks-gardens-beaches/toronto-island-park/">Toronto Islands</a>. Really liked that place. No wonder people can get such great shots of the Toronto skyline! Also, so many dogs!

After getting back, I've been updating the gallery pages to use a newer, template version that should make future changes easier. Hopefully I'll update the phtots themselves soon. Oh, and the <a href="{% link Gallery/2D.html %}">2D section</a> now exists. I haven't been able to get new paintings on there since I haven't done many recently. Perhaps I should add my sketches...

Oh- if you like the story-like posts like yesterday's. Contact me? Those are a bit more involved to make, but, if you guys like it... I might make a few occasionally.
