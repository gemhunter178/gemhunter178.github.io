 Yesterday we had final presentations. It's odd that I won't be seeing the people that came on this journey with me until next fall. Anyways, I was able to have a good time talking with them last night. I had to try to sleep early since I needed to catch a train at 5:29AM.
      

I almost missed it, the train left a few minutes after I got on. I did some final work as I watched the pastures and countryside roll on by. There's so much greenery here... and so many cows!
      

I pulled into London St. Pancreas station at around 7:30AM. My dad was there to greet me and I soon met up with my family, whom I haven't seen for 5 weeks. My brother even more.
      

We walked all over London (zone 1) today. A lot of gift shops, 2 galleries, a few filled-up tourist locations, and a nice night walk along the River Thames and my day was over.
      

I am a little dizzy from exhaustion at this point, so, I'll catch up with you all later.
