Ok, so I didn't get any pictures of my doing VR. Oh well.
      

Anyways, today was a very busy, but also relaxing day. Our morning started off uneventfully: We had to finish our d√©rive maps, so I was running photoshop and paint.NET between the two and using the pictures I took <a href="/Blog/12018May24">there.</a>
      

After that, we were instructed to walk to a place called <a href="http://houseofvr.com/">House of VR</a>. It was a cool walk. I got to see more of the wentern side of town (Parkdale regon). On this walk, we stopped to get all-you-can-eat sushi, which as delicious, and passed our destination to look around (we had 30 minutes to kill). So, we found....a toy store.
      

After some waiting and conversation, we were finally ready to try our some VR stuff. 
      

We started with some documentaries/"non-games" at first. Out of all of these documentaries, I liked <a href="https://www.manifest99.com/">Manifest 99</a> the best 
      

I didn't actually run through all the games provided as we only got 3 hours there. I do have to say watching others get into games is a cool and sometimes amusing position.
      

Ok, I am literally slamming my head against my latop and suddenly waking up from exhaustion...So I think I'll cut this very short. Sorry if today's blog went all over the place.
      

If you have a chance to try VR (like an HTC vive or Oculus), try it!
