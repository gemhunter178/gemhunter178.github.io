Today I left for Paris via. train. I'll talk about what I did in my short two days in London first though.
      

So, yesterday, we took a ferry to go see the London Eye. We decided not to go on due to time as well as the cost of the experience though. So, instead, we watched some street performers do their work, amazing crowds. After that, we walked back and crossed over the River Thames via the Millenium Bridge. We visited St. Paul's Cathedral and then made our way to Leadenhall Market (Harry Potter fan here. I think the real life Leaky Caudron was shot here?). The day ended with passing the Gherkin and taking some photos.
      

Early this morning, we made our ways to St. Pancreas Station to take the train over to Paris. I really wish we had time to play one of the pianos there. Either way, on the train, my family luckily had 4 seats around a table. So, we played "Oh Hell" (the card game). I won with a score of 107. Our first sights of France came when we got out of the tunnel under the English Channel. Lots of greenery, lots of farms. I'm a fan.
      

We ended the trip at Nord Station in Paris. We got off, got to the place we'll be in for the next week, and left, camera in hand, to explore around.
      

Of course, our first destination was the Eiffel Tower. We never went up today, but we did get some good pictures. The clouds were especially cooperative today.
      

Anyways, I'll be in Paris these few days. I'll make sure to post about it when I get time!
