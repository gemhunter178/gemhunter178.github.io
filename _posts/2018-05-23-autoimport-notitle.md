Once again I find myself looking at something online and saying "hey, maybe I can do that". Recently, I revisited a site I saw a few years back about <a href="http://www.justinngphoto.com/2014/05/16/how-i-photograph-the-milky-way-from-light-polluted-skies-of-singapore/">photographing hard-to-see celestial stuff with high light pollution</a> and thought I'd try it myself.
