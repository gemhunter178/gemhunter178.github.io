For those in the US, Happy 4th of July! Otherwise, just another blog post after some hiatus. 
      

So, if you read the title, I'm probably going to be changing the location of my blog to some site that does blogs like mine well (I'm thinking Tumblr). This way I can get feedback and whatnot easier.
      

Also, it allows me to see if anyone actually <i>reads</i> these things. Plus, each one of these posts requires me to make 2 pages and update another 2 for everything to work right. (I make this all in raw HTML on Github).
      

I do still want to post to keep people updated on my shenanigans, but it is getting to be a hassle here. Stay tuned for the switch?
      



P.S. The Blog link in the banner will no longer link here once I make the switch, but these pages will still exist under the same address (gemhunter178.com/Blog).
      

Hope to be back soon!
